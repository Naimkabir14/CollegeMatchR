For most Juniors and Seniors, college searching can be a hassle. Picking a college is a big decesion in a studnets life and not 
knowing where to start or where to look can leave a student overwhelmed. Coupled with finishing high school, college searching can be
a very disruptive force. Therefore, we have created a program that allows a student to search colleges in all 50 states in order to get 
specific information about each college. This information can help them see which college right for them.
